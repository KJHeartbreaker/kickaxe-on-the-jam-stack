Kickaxe Guitars is a cool little shop in Calgary, AB.

This marketing site is in the MVP stage as it has been migrated from WordPress to Next.JS, Sanity, and Vercel using Nick DiMatteo's excellent starter, Hull. For the time being (due to a really tight deadline), the eCommerce functionality has been disabled. Nevertheless, this only worked out due to the hard work that these guys did to create the starter.
